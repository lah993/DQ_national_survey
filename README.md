Heterogeneity in clinical research data quality monitoring: a national survey dataset

## Description
This repository contains the raw data collected from a web-based survey which aimed to explore the procedures for ensuring data quality in Australian clinical research studies. Clinical researchers were asked about their data quality monitoring procedures at all stages of a clinical study. This includes how data was defined, collected, stored, processed and represented. This dataset also include how data quality education and training was delivered to data entry staff and data managers. 

This dataset has the potential to be reused by but not limited to the biomedical and health informatics community in the management of data and knowledge relating to health and disease. Further, this dataset could be reused by clinical researchers to determine what procedures are being implemented by similar study types and designs to theirs. Lastly, as this dataset is limited to the Australian clinical research study setting and therefore it could be used to make international comparisons.

## How the data was collected
Data was collected through an online survey form. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies [1]. A detailed description of the data collection process can be found in the related research article. 

## Data format and files
The raw data provided by survey respondents has been provided in both a CSV file and Microsoft excel file for reuse. A data dictionary has been provided to support the raw data contents, format and structure. A PDF file has also been provided containing the survey questions and format. Please consider that adaptive question was applied throughout the survey, branching the total number of questions depending on individual survey responses. This is identified in the PDF file via question numbering.

## Value of the Data
•	This dataset is useful to the biomedical informatics and health informatics community who seek to improve outcomes, lower costs, increase safety and promote the use of high-quality services across health and healthcare delivery systems. 
•	A broad spectrum of clinical studies can benefit from this dataset to aid their decisions to implement or not implement certain procedures to monitor data quality.
• This data can be used for further insights into the reasons why certain types of clinical studies are not following and meeting national and international regulations; provide guidance for the development of supplementary clinical study resources; and guide the development of experiments associated to adopting technology to overcome challenges related to data collection, monitoring and upholding quality.
